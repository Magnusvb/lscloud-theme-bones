  * The collection could should be ‘featured’ to match the default collection for new stores. There should also be a fallback in case no collections exist.
* Latest blog posts (could be toggled on/off using theme option)
* Promotion image/link banner slider
* All sections of the homepage should be toggleable. In example if a theme has a text section on the homepage, this section should be togglable from the theme settings.

### Product page
If a certain setting is not turned on or being used don’t show it. For example if there is no volumetric pricing, don’t show a volumetric pricing title or empty table.
Mandatory things of product pages are: Title, price, quantity, images. The rest are optional
* SEO name for `<title>` (fallback to product name)
* Sale price (with base price crossed out)
* Product SKU
* Multiple product images
* Product options
* Product extras
* Product attributes (name + value in table)
* Short + long description
* Manufacturer (with link to manufacturer page, if product has manufacturer assigned)
* Product dimensions and weight (if > 0)
* Inventory (how many left in stock, if “track inventory” option is selected for product)
* Related products
* Upsells / Cross sells
* Product reviews
  * Total reviews number
  * Average rating
  * Title, comment, rating, author name
* Volume pricing tiers
  * If a product has volume pricing configured, they should show up on the product page (usually below the main description) as a list, or a table, showing pricing per unit by quantity. Example:
    * 10 - 19: $9/each
    * 20 - 29: $8.50/each

### Product listing / category page

  * Alphabetical
  * Date added
  * Price
* Manufacturer page
* Linked to from product page (if manufacturer is assigned to product)
* Display all products from X manufacturer

### Cart page
* Guest / login pathway (we should decide best UX for this)
  * Ideally should allow low-friction checkout, with ability to register *after* completing the purchase (not possible in LS at the moment). Or allow user to set their password in-context during the checkout itself.
* Cart items list
  * Item base price
  * Item discount price
  * Line subtotal
  * Product image
  * Link back to product page
  * Selected product options and extras

* Upsells / cross-sells (could be toggled on/off using theme option)

### Checkout page(s)
* Mini order review during checkout process

* “Accepts marketing” checkbox ticked by default

### Blog

  * Blog category list
  * Each post with featured image, author, date, category
* Blog post page
  * Title, date, category
  * Featured image
  * Author bio
    * Social links

### CMS Pages
* 1 - 3 different page templates for basic but different layouts
  * Will require ability for pages to handle multiple content regions in a simple way (not yet available)

### My Account area
* Login page
  * Forgot password link going to page or modal
  * Errors show up under fields when missing/filled incorrectly.

  * Sign up for email list is ticked by default

  * Use language like “Get occasional email updates from us”

### Customer Registration page
* Standard fields for registering

### Carts and Order Summaries
* The cart order totals/cart-discounts/item-discounts should match the checkout totals, receipt totals and order history totals. They should be consistent with each other and show item sales, item discounts, and cart discounts clearly and concisely. 
* Tips for concise checkouts:
  * To show discount/sales beside items cross out the original price and have the discount beside it
  * Having a total discounts section in the order summary helps clear up confusion

### Contact page
* Use contact form feature

### Coming Soon page
* This is meant as a landing page for merchants to use while they’re setting up their store.
  * Simple coming soon page template with a mailchimp form (tied to mailchimp list ID and API configured as a theme customization option)

## Product and category image handling
We need to establish some best-practices for image output settings to accommodate the most possible product images. Different retailers will have their product shots in different aspect ratios, different resolutions and sometimes won’t even be consistent across 1 company’s product catalog.
Some of this can be done with smart image output Twig code, and also some using theme options (perhaps by selecting between 3 different common aspect ratios).

## Tech considerations
* Minimize / combine CSS and Javascript files into 1 file each
  * Load JavaScript in footer asynchronously wherever possible
* Encouraged to use SASS
* Encouraged to use a standard (ideally, a lightweight one) CSS framework for layout
* Provide a custom CSS theme customization option (which uses a code editor) with some default selectors to help people get started. Output this as internal stylesheet across all theme pages.
* Where possible, only display things if they exist/aren’t null. For example:
  * If there’s no related products set for a particular product, hide the entire section for them on the product page.
  * If there’s no short description, don’t show it (or it’s container HTML element)
  * If there’s product pricing tiers available for the currently logged in user, display them on product page, otherwise don’t.
  * If there’s only 1 shipping method, auto-select and skip
  * If there’s only 1 payment method, auto-select and skip
* Run [https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/](PageSpeed) throughout development and follow guidelines to optimize performance.
* Should be a static page template built and used for pages like About us, Contact Us
* Registered customers should have checkout fields pre-populated for them whenever possible.

## Theme customization options
* Preset color schemes (drop-down or color swatches)
* Font-selection drop-down (Google fonts or Typekit) (optional)
