#Bones V2

A barebones theme for Lemonstand, this is a great starting point from which to
build your own custom theme.

##Configuration

Under Store Design then Theme Settings you will find many documented options
that you can use to configure this theme. Configuration done elsewhere is
documented below.

To add a page that will be linked from the top menu, in the backend go to
Content, then Site Pages, then click New Entry. Pages will only be shown when
their status is set to "published".
